# ETL_Project

For this project, we extracted and transformed Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian and cyclist data counts for the month of October 2017. I used the dataset from the DOT with counts for days without preciptiation. 

I extracted the data from NY DOT's data sets. 

I transformed the tables with the columns i wanted to combine.

I created two tables in SQL: Pedestrian and Cyclist

I loaded the SQL tables into a new combined database.
